# Randomation Vehicle Physics
This is a vehicle physics system for the Unity engine, tested with Unity 5.5. It aims to achieve semi-realistic, general-purpose driving mechanics. This was originally sold on the asset store as Randomation Vehicle Physics 2.0.

If you add new properties/variables when contributing, make sure their default values do not change the behavior of the included prefabs.

Documentation can be found in [the manual](Assets/RVP_Manual.pdf).

# How To Use

Import the repository into the top level of a blank Unity project folder to make sure everything works. After that, you can attempt to import it into your own project, but be mindful when merging the project settings. Read the section of the manual about project settings to make sure you copy the ones that are important and address potential conflicts with your own project settings.
